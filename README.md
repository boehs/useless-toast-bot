# Discord Toast Bot

A useless toast bot! once you get it up and running... just ping it in dms... or, add it to a server and ping it then

# Is there a already existing bot?

Yes! `Ping For Toast#5001` or add him to any server using https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=743109027831218176&scope=bot&permissions=67488832

## Cool! what do I need?

### Files needed to create

You will need to create a file called .env and add to the file
`TOKEN=YOURDISCORDTOKENWITHOUTSPACES`

### Things I need to make

A discord bot! Just set up a bot... and create the .env using your new token

### Software I need

- Node.js
- NPM

### Packages I need

- discord.js
- request (not needed right now... but I am planning to transition from fetch to request)
- node-fetch
- dotenv-flow

I also HIGHLY reccomend getting the package nodemon. this will automaticly restart the bot each time you save the code.
For that... instead of `node .` Write `nodemon --inspect index.js`. then sit back and get coden

# How to use the bot

In a server your new bot is in... ping it... or write `Toast` (not case sensitive)
The bot will dm you toast. you can dm the bot Toast and it will do the same thing

Write `!!About` and the bot will give you a info blurb

Write `super secret stuff lol` and it will print into the cosole hosting the bot info about the servers its in.

Write `Toast`, or `!!Toast` or ping the bot to get toast.

Write `Toast Noise` or `!!toast noise` to be gross

thats really it.

# Why do I get the same image for like 3 seconds if I spam?

the bot is being rate limited by imgur. plz no spam.
